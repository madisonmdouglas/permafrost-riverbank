Scripts written in Matlab v2022a under academic license to Caltech.
Download all scripts and run "PfModelRunfile_BaseCase.m" to produce figure 3.
The base model includes permafrost bank erosion limitations by pore-ice thaw, sediment entrainment, and slump block erosion.
The script also runs versions without slump blocks and/or sediment entrainment for comparison.
Model is run for representative water discharge and temperature curves calculated for Stevens Village, AK (data in StevensVillageforModel_v3.mat).
